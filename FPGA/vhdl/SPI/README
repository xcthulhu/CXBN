SPI_MASTER_SLAVE
----------------

VHDL files for spi master/slave project:

        spi_master.vhd          spi master module, can be used independently
        spi_slave.vhd           spi slave module, can be used independently
        spi_loopback.vhd        wrapper module for the master and slave modules
        spi_loopback_test.vhd   testbench for the loopback module, test master against slave
        spi_loopback.ucf        constraints file for Spartan-6, optimized for area, LUT compression.


The original development is done in Xilinx ISE 13.1, targeted to a Spartan-6 device.

Verification was done in ISIM, after Place & Route, with default constraints, for the slowest 
Spartan-6 device, synthesis generated 59 slices, and the design was tested at 40MHz for the 
spi_2x_clk (20MHz spi SCK), and 125MHz for the parallel interfaces clocks.
With the attached .ucf file, optimized for area and using LUT compression, synthesis generated
44 slices, and design tested OK at 20MHz of SPI clock.
